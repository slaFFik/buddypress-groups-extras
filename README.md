# BuddyPress Groups Extras

BuddyPress Groups doesn't have much predefined content inside. Forums and activity are created (or not) by users. But most of the time group creators (aka administrators) have much more to say or explain to other members of community.

BuddyPress Groups Extras will give them an ability to create extra content.

## General
* Choose groups you want to allow custom fields and pages in
* Define who will have access to managing fields or pages in groups (groups admins or site admins, or both)
* Create predefined Set of Fields that can be imported to all groups on a site OR can be imported on per group basis
* Get tutorials on how to use the plugin (simplified and advanced variants) right in your admin area
* Tweak various options, like enabling Rich Editor
* Drag-n-drop groups nav menu items as you wish (Fields and Pages can be your new group front page!)

## Groups Custom Fields
* Create custom fields using various field types (radios, checkboxes, dropdown select, textarea and text)
* Edit fields data on Edit Group Details page in the Group Admin area
* Display / hide the page where all group fields are displayed (and rename it too)
* Reorder fields

## Groups Custom Pages
* Create group pages (for group FAQ or wiki, or events, or descriptions or whatever you want)
* Edit pages data in the Group Admin area using WordPress Classis Editor (with embedding the content that WordPress supports!)
* Display / hide page where all group pages are displayed (and rename it too)
* Reorder pages
