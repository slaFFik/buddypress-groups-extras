BuddyPress Groups doesn't have much predefined content inside. Forums and activity are created (or not) by users. But most of the time group creators (aka administrators) have much more to say or explain to other members of community.

BuddyPress Groups Extras will give ability to them to create extra content.

* Get tutorials on how to use the plugin (simplified and advanced variants) right in your admin area

## Groups Custom Fields

* Edit fields data on Edit Group Details page in Group Admin area
