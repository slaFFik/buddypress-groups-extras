Give your groups the ability to have any custom fields admins want. Also, an extra page will appear with the chosen content (with subpages).

== Description ==

BuddyPress Groups doesn't have much-predefined content inside. Forums and activities are created (or not) by users. But most of the time group creators (aka administrators) have much more to say or explain to other members of the community.

BuddyPress Groups Extras will give the ability to them to create extra content.

= General =
* Choose groups you want to allow custom fields and pages.
* Define who will have access to managing fields or pages in groups (groups admins or site admins or both).
* Create a predefined Set of Fields that can be imported to all groups on a site OR can be imported on a per-group basis.
* Tweak various options, like enabling Rich Editor.
* Drag-n-drop groups nav menu items as you wish (Fields and Pages can be your new group front page!).

= Groups Custom Fields =
* Create custom fields using various types (radios, checkboxes, dropdown select, textarea, and text).
* Edit fields data on Edit Group Details page in Group Admin area.
* Display/hide page, where all groups fields will be displayed (and rename it too).
* Reorder fields.

= Groups Custom Pages =
* Create group pages (for group FAQ or wiki, or events, or descriptions or whatever you want).
* Edit page data in the Group Admin area using WordPress RichEditor (with embedding content that WordPress supports!).
* Display/hide page, where all group pages will be displayed (and rename it too).
* Reorder pages.

Make your groups full of possibilities!

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin folder `/buddypress-groups-extras/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the Settings > BP Groups Extras menu and make customizations as needed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't I see Fields/Pages in group navigation after plugin activation and enabling it for that particular group? =
Please go to group admin area and define Fields and Pages navigation labels and check them to Show. This is done to prevent displaying empty pages with no content.

= How can I change the look and feel of a plugin output in groups? =
= How can I redefine templates? =
Starting from BPGE v3.6 you can now change the html that is used to display any content in front-end (in groups) right from your theme folder. This is useful if you want to change the way pages and fields are displayed, but it works for "Admin -> Extras" management pages as well.

To do this you need to create a folder called `bpge` in the root of your theme. So for example if you use Frisco theme, create a folder like this: `wp-content/themes/frisco-for-buddypress/bpge`. Then copy a required file (that you want to modify) from this plugin folder `wp-content/plugins/buddypress-groups-extras/views/front` to that created in a theme. That is it - now the plugin uses the template from your theme.
